# Airline Reservation System

**Group Project**: This system is a collaborative effort developed by Joe, Michele, and Jacob.

**User Interaction**: The system interacts with users through a menu-driven interface, where users can input their information, choose aircraft, select flight classes, and assign seats.

**Data Handling**: User information such as name, last name, and date is collected. Aircraft information, including model and capacity, is managed. The system also handles flight classes and seat assignments.

**Classes and Inheritance**: The system seems to utilize object-oriented programming principles, with classes like Aircraft, Flyer, Accessible, and PrivateJet. These classes likely represent different aspects of the reservation system, with inheritance possibly indicating relationships between them.

**File Handling**: There are indications of file handling, likely for storing user information, seat assignments, and boarding passes.

**Error Handling**: Basic error handling is present, such as verifying user information and handling invalid menu choices.
